Question4
Which of the following graphs depicts the effect of substrate
concentration on velocity of enzyme catalysed reaction?
[NEET 2024 Re]
Options:

A.

B.

C.

D.

Answer: A

Solution:
Option (1) is the correct answer because with the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of enzymatic reaction
rises at first. The reaction ultimately reaches maximum velocity (Vmax.) which is not exceeded by anyfurther rise in
concentration of the substrate. This is because the enzyme molecules are fewer than substrate molecules and after
saturation of these molecules, there are no free enzyme molecules to bind the additional substrate molecules

Option (2) is incorrect as velocity of reaction is continuously increasing in the given graph.
In option (3) after reaching at Vmax, velocity declines while in option (4) velocity of reaction declines from high on
increasing substrate concentration. So, option (3) and (4) are incorrect.

Question46
Which one of the following statements is incorrect?
(2015 Cancelled)
Options:

A. The competitive inhibitor does not affect the rate of breakdown of the enzyme-substrate
complex.
B. The presence of the competitive inhibitor decreases the K m of the enzyme for the substrate.
C. A competitive inhibitor reacts reversibly with the enzyme to form an enzyme inhibitor
complex.
D. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor molecule is not chemically changed by theenzyme.
Answer: B

Solution:
Solution:
(b): Competitive inhibition is a reversible inhibition where inhibitor competes with the normal substrate for the active site
of enzyme. A competitive inhibitor is usually chemically similar to the normal substrate and therefore, fits into the active
site of an enzyme and binds with it. The inhibition is thus due to substrate analogue. The enzyme, now cannot act upon
the substrate and reaction products are not formed. E.g., the activity of succinate dehydrogenase is inhibited by
malonate. K m value or Michaelis constant is defined as the substrate concentration at which half of the enzyme
molecules are forming enzyme substrate (ES) complex, or concentration of the substrate when the velocity of the
enzyme reaction is half the maximal possible. A smaller K m value indicates greater affinity of the enzyme for its
substrate, hence, shows a quicker reaction. The competitive inhibitor decreases the affinity of enzyme for substrate, thus
increases the K m value.

Question47
Select the option which is not correct with respect to enzyme action.
(2014)
©

Options:

A. Substrate binds with enzyme at its active site.
B. Addition of lot of succinate does not reverse the inhibition of succinic dehydrogenase by
malonate.
C. A non-competitive inhibitor binds the enzyme at a site distinct from that which binds the
substrate.
D. Malonate is a competitive inhibitor of succinic dehydrogenase.
Answer: B

Solution:

(b) : The reduction of activity of succinate dehydrogenase by malonate is an example of competitive inhibition.
Competitive inhibition is a reversible inhibition where inhibitor competes with the normal substrate for the active site of
enzyme. A competitive inhibitor is usually similar to the normal substrate and, therefore, fits into the active site of an
enzyme and binds with it. The enzyme, now cannot act upon the substrate and reaction products are not formed. Hence,
action of an enzyme may be reduced or inhibited. since a competitive inhibitor occupies the site only temporarily, the
enzyme action is not permanently affected. Thus, addition of a lot of succinate can reverse the inhibition of succinic
dehydrogenase by malonate.

site on the enzyme.
C. Non-competitive inhibition of an enzyme can be overcome by adding large amount of
substrate.
D. Non-competitive inhibitors often bind to the enzyme irreversibly.
Answer: B

Solution:

(b): Competitive inhibition is a reversible inhibition where inhibitor competes with the normal substrate for the active site
of enzyme. A competitive inhibitor is usually chemically similar to the normal substrate and therefore, fits into the active
site of an enzyme and binds with it. The inhibition is thus due to substrate analogue. The enzyme, now cannot act upon
the substrate and reaction products are not formed. E.g., the activity of succinate dehydrogenase is inhibited by
malonate. K m value or Michaelis constant is defined as the substrate concentration at which half of the enzyme
molecules are forming enzyme substrate (ES) complex, or concentration of the substrate when the velocity of the
enzyme reaction is half the maximal possible. A smaller K m value indicates greater affinity of the enzyme for its
substrate, hence, shows a quicker reaction. The competitive inhibitor decreases the affinity of enzyme for substrate, thus
increases the K m value.

Question82
Role of enzyme in reactions is to/as
(2000)
Options:

A. decrease activation energy
B. increase activation energy
C. inorganic catalyst
D. none of the above.
Answer: A

Solution:

(a) : All molecules require certain amount of energy for activation (to overcome energy barrier) before they can react.
This energy is called activation energy. This energy is recovered when products are formed. The essence of an enzyme is
its ability to speed up (catalyze) a reaction by making or breaking specific covalent bonds (bonds in which atoms are held
together by sharing of electrons). Enzymes act by somehow lowering the temperature at which a given bond is unstable
i.e., they speed up a reaction by lowering the activation energy. It is the magnitude of the activation energy which
determines how fast the reaction will proceed.

(c) : Feedback inhibition or end product inhibition is the inhibition of the activity of an enzyme catalysing some early
reactions of the series by the end product of the metabolic pathway. For example a substrate A is converted into a
product F through B, C, D and E intermediate products. As the concentration of end product F increases, it diffuses to
allosteric enzyme (E) causing a reduced synthesis of the product B which in turn lowers the rate of enzymatic reactions in
rest of the pathway.

Question90
Which is a typical example of 'feedback inhibition'?
(1996)
Options:

A. Cyanide and cytochrome reaction
B. Sulpha drugs and folic acid synthesizer bacteria
C. Allosteric inhibition of hexokinase by glucose 6 -phosphate
D. Reaction between succinic dehydro-genase and succinic acid
Answer: C

Solution:
Solution:
(c) : Feedback inhibition or end product inhibition occurs when the end product of a metabolic pathway inhibits the
activity of an enzyme catalysing some early reactions of the series. The end product is the inhibitor and the enzyme
inactivated is called allosteric enzyme. The enzyme is regulated by modulators that bind noncovalently at site other than
the active site. An example of feedback inhibition is the inhibition of the activity of the enzyme hexokinase by glucose 6 phosphate in glycolysis. This enzyme catalyses conversion of glucose into glucose 6 -phosphate but as the reaction
proceeds, increase in concentration of glucose 6-phosphate inhibits the activity of hexokinase.

(1996)
©

Options:

A. Lipids
B. Mineral salts
C. Proteins
D. Carbohydrates
Answer: C

Solution:
Solution:
(c) : Proteins show enormous diversity because of different proportions and sequences of twenty amino acid within the
protein molecule. A large number of permutations and combinations of these amino acids are responsible for the
unlimited variety of proteins. Proteins are the most abundant and most varied of the macromolecules having one or more
polypeptides (chains of amino acids). The proteins constitute almost 50 % of the total dry weight of the cell. Proteins may

be simple or conjugated. Among conjugated, proteins may be phosphoprotein, glycoprotein, nucleoprotein,
chromoprotein, lipoprotein, flavoprotein, metallo protein etc. Functionally proteins may be structural protein, enzymes,
hormones, respiratory pigment etc.

©

Options:

A. Cu
B. M g
C. Cu and Mg
D. F e
Answer: D

Solution:
Solution:
(d) : Cytochromes are generally membranebound hemoproteins that contain heme groups and carry out electron
transport. The heme group is a highly conjugated ring system (which means its electrons are very mobile) surrounding a
metal ion, which readily interconverts between the oxidation states. For many cytochromes the metal ion present is that
of iron, which interconverts between F e2+ (reduced) and F e3+ (oxidized) states (electron-transfer processes) or between
2+
3+
F e (reduced) and F e (formal, oxidized) states (oxidative processes). Cytochromes are thus capable of performing
oxidation and reduction.
