       "  'solution': '(b): Competitive inhibition is a reversible inhibition where inhibitor competes with the normal substrate for the active site\\nof enzyme. A competitive inhibitor is usually chemically similar to the normal substrate and therefore, fits into the active\\nsite of an enzyme and binds with it. The inhibition is thus due to substrate analogue. The enzyme, now cannot act upon\\nthe substrate and reaction products are not formed.
