    "topic": "The Living World",
    "exam name": "NEET",
    "exam year": 2011,
    "answer": "C",
    "solution": "Metabolism is the process by which all living things assimilate energy and use it for various purposes such as growth, movement, locomotion etc. This mechanism of metabolism is not shown by nonliving objects. However, some of the metabolic reactions can be carried out in a cell-free system or outside the cells. Isolated metabolic reactions in vitro are not living things but are living reactions. Hence, statement A is incorrect. All living organisms show growth either by multiplication or by an increase in size. It is an irreversible increase in the mass of individual from inside. Two types of substances are produced by the cells, apoplastic and protoplastic. Apoplastic substances are nonliving materials formed by the cells which become components of tissues. For example, cell wall, the matrix of bone etc. Protoplastic substances are the components of living matter like cytoplasm and nucleus. Although some nonliving things like mountains, sand mounds, crystals also grow, their growth is due to the addition of matter from outside. Hence, statements B and D are incorrect. All organisms respond to external stimuli which can be physical, chemical or biological. This is called irritability. Stimuli are perceived by sense organs in animals but plants can respond to external factors like water, temperature, light etc. All organisms from prokaryote to the most complex eukaryotes can sense and respond to environmental events. So, the correct answer is 'Perception of events happening in the environment and their memory'."

Species is also a genetically closed system because its members do not interbreed with members of other species. Species is the lowest or basic taxonomic category, e.g., mango (Mangifera indica), potato (Solanum tuberosum), lion (Panthera leo). Here indica, tuberosum, leo are species of genera Mangifera, Solanum and Pantera respectively. All other taxonomic categories are defined and described in relation to species. For example, a genus is a group of species and a subspecies or a variety is a part of species. New species originate from already existing species.

Genera Plantarum's first edition includes brief descriptions of the 935 genera of plants known to Linnaeus at that time. It is dedicated to Herman Boerhaave, a physician from Leiden who introduced George Clifford to Linnaeus and the Dutch medico-botanical establishment of the day. In his method of classification, plants are grouped according to the number of stamens and pistils in a flower, as used by Genera Plantarum. In the 1753 edition of Species Plantarum, which is now taken as the starting point for all botanical nomenclature, Linnaeus developed the system of binomial nomenclature through the widespread acceptance of his list of plants. Genera Plantarum was an important part of the first step towards a standardized universal biological nomenclature."
