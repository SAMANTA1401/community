Rhodophyceae, commonly known as red algae, are predominantly colored by the pigment r-phycoerythrin. This pigment reflects red light and absorbs blue light, which allows red algae to live at greater depths than many other types of algae because blue light penetrates water deeper than light of longer wavelengths.

    "exam year": ["2023 mpr"],
    "answer": "A",
    "solution": "(A) Statement is absolutely correct that \"all pteridophytes exhibit haplo-diplontic pattern\" - Yes, that's correct. In pteridophytes, which includes ferns and their allies, the haplo-diplontic life cycle is observed. There is an alternation of generations between a haploid (n) gametophyte stage and a diploid (2n) sporophyte stage. Both stages are free-living and independent. (B) Seed-bearing plants are gymnosperms and angiosperms and both of them follow diplontic life cycle pattern. In these groups, the sporophyte generation is dominant, and the gametophyte generation is reduced and dependent on the sporophyte. The life cycle is thus said to be diplontic. (C) Most algal genera are haplontic This is generally true. The majority of algae, especially the green algae (Chlorophyta) and red algae (Rhodophyta), exhibit a haplontic life cycle where the dominant, photosynthetic phase is the haploid gametophyte. (D) Most bryophytes have haplo-diplontic life cycle pattern - Bryophytes, including mosses, liverworts, and hornworts, do have a haplo-diplontic life cycle. In this cycle, there is an alternation of generations between a haploid (n) gametophyte stage and a diploid (2n) sporophyte stage. However, in bryophytes, the gametophyte stage is dominant and long-lived while the sporophyte is dependent on the gametophyte and short-lived.",

    "solution": "The phenomenon of phototropism is the growth of organisms in response to light. Charles Darwin and his son Francis Darwin were among the early scientists to study phototropism. They found that light is perceived by the tip of the plant shoot, and this perception leads to growth further down the shoot. Later, it was discovered that a hormone, named auxin, is responsible for this effect. Auxin accumulates on the side of the plant facing away from the light source, and causes cells on that side to elongate, thus bending the plant towards the light. This played a major role in the discovery of auxin, which is one of the main plant hormones. While auxins do also influence other processes like root initiation, gravitropism, and apical dominance, their role in phototropism was significant to their discovery.",

(B) Gibberellin (III) Increase in the length of grape stalks: Gibberellins are plant hormones that stimulate stem elongation, seed germination, and flowering. They are known to increase the length of grape stalks. (C) Cytokinin (II) Overcoming apical dominance: Cytokinins are plant hormones that promote cell division and delay leaf senescence. They also play a role in overcoming apical dominance, encouraging the growth of lateral buds.

    "solution": "(d) Phloem, a complex tissue, is found in highly organised plants (“higher plants”) and characterised by the possession of certain specialised cells, the sieve elements, and which functions as the major channel of rapid conduction of sugars over fairly long distances in the plant body. In addition to sieve elements, it always contains parenchyma cells, usually of more than one type, and frequently includes sclerenchyma cells. Phloem in gymnosperms lacks both sieve tube and companion cells.",
